- What to do for mixed meshes with a reduced representations? Say ones with regions and faces.

1. We can force the representation to be one which explicitly represents regions and faces (regions are made up of faces).
OR
2. We can have a general element entity which is either a region or a face or an edge; becomes more complicated but is more general.

- Element node representations have to allow for face-node and region-node representations. If a reduced representation allows regions, faces and nodes, and we built only a surface mesh, we have to have a face-node representation and add the region part later.


- Flag to indicate which representation is being used?
	typedef enum {F1=0, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, R1, R2, R3, R4} repType;
	char str[10][5] = {"F1","F2","F3","F4","F5","F6","R1","R2","R4"};
	repTYpe rtype;

We are going to represent the nmber of upward adjacencies of an entity represented by 'unsigned char' I believe this should be 255 items. Will this be enough for Delaunay meshing?
