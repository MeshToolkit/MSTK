Changes v1.83rc1

Fixed CMakeLists.txt so that it can recognize HDF5 hints

Fixed bugs in recognizing tetrahedral and hexahedral elements

Put in code to properly answer queries for prisms and pyramids

Introduced unit tests

Changed chkmesh utility so that it distinguishes between truly inverted elements
and those that are just not star shaped (some tets in the decomposition of 
non-simplex elements are inside out but the total volume of the element is positive)

Changes v1.82

Bug fix in ME_Faces_R1R2

Can read R1 type representation into F1 type mesh

Added utils with meshconvert and chkmesh

Removed use of unistd.h from MESH_ExportToDXBin to enable Windows compile

Fixed GMV export of Prisms and Pyramids



Changes v1.81

Bug fixes / Improvements to parallel functionality

Bug fixes to build system

Added code to Collapse edges in 3D

Added code to merge faces 


Changes v1.8

* Parallel Mesh functionality

Changes v1.71

* Fixes to import from Exodus file format

* Added MSets which are Mesh entity sets or named lists

* Exodus export routine

* DX export routine

* Bug fixes

Changes v1.7

* THE MSTKUTIL LIBS HAVE BEEN ABSORBED INTO MSTK. THERE IS NO NEED TO
  COMPILE MSTKUTIL AND MSTK SEPARATELY

* A major change was made to MESH_Rem_* routines. These cut the removal
  time of each mesh entity from O(n) to O(log(n)) with mesh renumbering 
  and O(1) without mesh renumbering. This should make mesh
  modification codes much faster

* Support for reduced representations has been added with on-the-fly 
  creation of virtual entities, automatic cleanup of virtual entities,
  and locking of virtual entities to avoid intermediate deletion.
 
  NOTE: THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED EXTENSIVELY SO SOME BUGS MAY EXIST

* Can read/write MSTK files in R1 format while the mesh is of type F1

* Support for VECTOR and TENSOR type attributes added

* Support for reading/writing attributes in MSTK files added


* Many bug fixes and efficiency improvements
